I want to convert my 401K to Roth IRA and want to simulate the outcome. I have a parameter （total_401K_asset） for the total amount. Top-level simulation parameters are already in the file. 

Starting from the year 2027, I want to compare the following conversion scenarios: 
1. aggressive -- each year the target withdrawal amount is 1/10 of the total  
2. intermediate -- each year withdrawal is 1/15 of the total 
3. moderate -- 1/20 of the total each year 
4. conservative -- 1/25  of the total each year 


In each of the scenario, simulate in the incoming years up to the end_simulation_year as the following: 
1. If the year is beyond ss_start_year, offset the withdrawal amount by social security amount. Else, do not offset. 
2. Compute the tax amount using today's tax bracket values. Assume that we are paying tax on the 401K withdrawal (as ordinary income), social security amount (if any), and the ordinary_income_other. Note the tax amount 
3. if withdrawal amount is bigger than the 401 asset value,  then cap the withdrawal amount ot be the 401K asset value. 
4. move withdrawal_amount from 401K to Roth IRA
5. grow both by (growth_rate - inflation_rate)

For this simulation, create a dict variable assets containing keys '401K'
and 'Roth', similar to that in withdrawal_rsu_401K.py. 

At the end of simulating the scenario, compute the tax-free wealth, and subtract the total tax amount. Report the outcome for each of the scenarios.
